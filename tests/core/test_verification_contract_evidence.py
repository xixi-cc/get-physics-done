            ### Quantifier / Domain Coverage
            | Obligation | Proof Location | Status | Notes |
            | --- | --- | --- | --- |
            | `for all x > 0` | theorem-proof.tex:9 | covered | No specialization introduced. |
            | `for all r_0 >= 0` | theorem-proof.tex:12 | covered | Retained through the final inequality. |

            ### Conclusion-Clause Coverage
            | Clause | Proof Location | Status | Notes |
            | --- | --- | --- | --- |
            | `F(x, r_0) >= 0` | theorem-proof.tex:14 | covered | Final displayed inequality. |

            ## Adversarial Probe
            - Probe type: dropped-parameter test
            - Result: The proof still tracks r_0 in the correction term, so the full claim survives.

            ## Verdict
            - Scope status: `matched`
            - Quantifier status: `matched`
            - Counterexample status: `none_found`
            - Blocking gaps:
              - None.

            ## Required Follow-Up
            - None.
