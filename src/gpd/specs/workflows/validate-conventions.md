<purpose>
Thin wrapper around `gpd-consistency-checker` for convention validation.

This workflow resolves the requested scope, delegates the physics policy to the checker, and accepts success only after the checker return plus expected consistency report artifact pass the local gate. The checker owns the convention logic; this workflow gates scope, artifact presence, and post-return routing.

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
Load project context and scope:

```bash
PHASE_ARG="${ARGUMENTS:-}"
if [ -n "${PHASE_ARG}" ]; then
  INIT=$(gpd --raw init phase-op --include state,roadmap,config "${PHASE_ARG}")
else
  INIT=$(gpd --raw init progress --include state,roadmap,config)
fi
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd initialization failed: $INIT"
  # STOP; surface the error.
fi
```

Parse JSON for: `state_exists`, `roadmap_exists`, `phases`, `current_phase`, `derived_convention_lock`, and when phase-scoped `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`.

Read mode settings:

```bash
AUTONOMY=$(gpd --raw config get autonomy 2>/dev/null | gpd json get .value --default supervised 2>/dev/null || echo "supervised")
COGNITIVE_PROFILE=$(gpd --raw config get cognitive_profile 2>/dev/null | gpd json get .value --default base-model-first 2>/dev/null || echo "base-model-first")
```

Run centralized context preflight before continuing:

```bash
CONTEXT=$(gpd --raw validate command-context validate-conventions "$ARGUMENTS")
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "$CONTEXT"
  exit 1
fi
```

If `state_exists` is false:

```
No project state found. Run gpd:new-project first.
```

Exit.

Resolve scope immediately after preflight:

- If `$PHASE_ARG` is set, require `phase_found: true` from `init phase-op` and derive a single-phase scope from `phase_dir`.
- If `$PHASE_ARG` is empty, scan all completed phases from `gpd --raw roadmap analyze`.
- If the requested phase cannot be resolved, fail closed with `ERROR: Phase not found: ${PHASE_ARG}`.

Capture the selected phase directory and roadmap view for the downstream scan:

```bash
ROADMAP=$(gpd --raw roadmap analyze)
```

Load the convention ledger and the canonical vocabulary:

```bash
CONVENTIONS=$(gpd convention list)
# Canonical snake_case machine labels + human display names. Pass this to the
# consistency-checker so its structured output stays on the authoritative
# vocabulary and does not invent ad-hoc keys like "source_status".
CONVENTION_VOCABULARY=$(gpd --raw convention vocabulary 2>/dev/null || echo "{}")
```

Read `GPD/CONVENTIONS.md` when present so the checker can compare the human-readable convention record against the structured lock. If the file is missing, continue with the structured lock and report the missing artifact as a limitation rather than inventing a fallback policy.
</step>

<step name="delegate_checker">
Spawn `gpd-consistency-checker` once and let it own convention policy.

Use the requested scope to choose checker mode:

- `PHASE_ARG` present -> `rapid`
- no phase argument -> `full`

For the checker prompt, provide only the scope, expected artifact path, and the required project files. Do not restate the checker's severity taxonomy or convention policy here.

Derive the routed scope explicitly:

```bash
if [ -n "${PHASE_ARG}" ]; then
  CHECKER_MODE="rapid"
  CHECK_SCOPE="phase ${PHASE_ARG}"
  EXPECTED_ARTIFACT="GPD/phases/${PHASE_DIR}/CONSISTENCY-CHECK.md"
else
  CHECKER_MODE="full"
  CHECK_SCOPE="all completed phases"
  EXPECTED_ARTIFACT="GPD/CONSISTENCY-CHECK.md"
fi
```

Expected artifact:

- phase-scoped run: `GPD/phases/${PHASE_DIR}/CONSISTENCY-CHECK.md`
- project-wide run: `GPD/CONSISTENCY-CHECK.md`

If `PHASE_ARG` is set, capture `PHASE_DIR` from the scoped init payload:

```bash
PHASE_DIR=$(echo "$INIT" | gpd json get .phase_dir --default "")
```

Use the selected scope to gather summary artifacts:

```bash
if [ -n "${PHASE_ARG}" ]; then
  for SUMMARY in "${PHASE_DIR}"/*SUMMARY.md; do
    gpd --raw summary-extract "$SUMMARY" --field conventions --field affects
  done
else
  for SUMMARY in GPD/phases/*/*SUMMARY.md; do
    gpd --raw summary-extract "$SUMMARY" --field conventions --field affects
  done
fi
```

Runtime delegation rule: this is a one-shot handoff. Follow the included delegation note; the checker returns instead of waiting for input, and this wrapper handles the local route after return.

```bash
CHECKER_MODEL=$(gpd resolve-model gpd-consistency-checker)
```

```
task(
  subagent_type="gpd-consistency-checker",
  model="{CHECKER_MODEL}",
  readonly=false,
  prompt="First, read {GPD_AGENTS_DIR}/gpd-consistency-checker.md for your role and instructions.

<mode>{CHECKER_MODE}</mode>
<scope>{CHECK_SCOPE}</scope>
<expected_artifacts>
- {EXPECTED_ARTIFACT}
</expected_artifacts>

Validate convention consistency for the requested scope.
Read the structured init payload, the current convention lock, GPD/STATE.md, GPD/state.json, GPD/CONVENTIONS.md, and the relevant SUMMARY artifacts.
Write the report to the expected artifact path and return the canonical gpd_return envelope.",
  description="Validate conventions for {CHECK_SCOPE}"
)
```

If the checker returns `gpd_return.status: completed`, accept success only after verifying that:

1. The expected artifact exists on disk.
2. The same path appears in `gpd_return.files_written`.

If either check fails, treat the handoff as incomplete and do not accept success.
</step>

<step name="route_return">
Route only on the canonical `gpd_return.status`:

Other status literals for this route map: `gpd_return.status: checkpoint`, `gpd_return.status: blocked`, and `gpd_return.status: failed`.

- `completed`: the checker finished for the selected scope; verify the expected artifact and `files_written`, then surface advisory items from `gpd_return.issues` without reinterpreting the status text.
- `checkpoint`: the checker needs user input; present options, checkpoint, and return. End with `## > Next Up`: primary `gpd:resume-work`, plus `gpd:validate-conventions` and `gpd:suggest-next`.
- `blocked` / `failed`: the checker could not complete; surface `gpd_return.issues`, keep the run fail-closed, and end with `## > Next Up`: primary `gpd:validate-conventions`, plus `gpd:resume-work`, `gpd convention set <key> <value>` when a lock repair is known, and `gpd:suggest-next`.

Do not route on checker-local text markers or headings. Those are presentation only; use the typed return route above.

If the checker's `next_actions` call for notation repair, classify the repair
from the report before routing it:

- Under `base-model-first`, apply a direct registry-first repair in the current
  main context only when the requested change is an exact, unambiguous diff to
  the canonical convention ledger and does not alter physical meaning. Use
  `gpd convention set`, update `GPD/CONVENTIONS.md`, and preserve the same
  autonomy/write boundary.
- Spawn `gpd-notation-coordinator` under `classic`, for an explicit fresh
  isolation request, unresolved physical-meaning ambiguity, or cross-source or
  cross-subfield conflict. Keep that handoff thin and use the same scope: the
  coordinator owns the ambiguous repair policy, not this workflow.
- Never infer a convention value from prose merely to keep the main-context
  route. An uncertain repair remains a checkpoint or fresh independent handoff.

Verify that `GPD/CONVENTIONS.md` exists and that `gpd convention list` reflects the resolved fields before accepting the update. Convention artifact and lock re-verified after notation resolution before success is accepted.
</step>

<step name="report">
Present a concise convention report:

- scope scanned
- expected artifact path
- returned status value
- any advisory issues or blocker issues
- whether the artifact gate passed

Before accepting any repaired result from the notation coordinator, re-check that `GPD/CONVENTIONS.md` exists and that `gpd convention list` reflects the resolved fields.

If the checker completed and the artifact gate passed, return the updated report to the user.
