**Phase 8: Citation Verification**

Spawn the bibliographer agent to verify all citations collected during the review. The bibliographer has the hallucination detection protocol, INSPIRE/ADS/arXiv search capability, and BibTeX management expertise needed for citation verification.

```bash
REVIEW_HANDOFF_INIT=$(load_literature_review_stage review_handoff "${topic:-$ARGUMENTS}")
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd initialization failed: $REVIEW_HANDOFF_INIT"
  exit 1
fi
```

Apply `REVIEW_HANDOFF_INIT.staged_loading.field_access_instruction` before reading `REVIEW_HANDOFF_INIT`.
Reference artifacts may be hydrated here, while active reference and protocol prose remain handle-first through `active_references`, `reference_artifact_files`, and `protocol_bundle_load_manifest`.

Resolve bibliographer model:

```bash
BIBLIO_MODEL=$(gpd resolve-model gpd-bibliographer)
```
@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/orchestration/runtime-delegation-note.md

```
task(
  subagent_type="gpd-bibliographer",
  model="{biblio_model}",
  readonly=false,
  prompt="First, read {GPD_AGENTS_DIR}/gpd-bibliographer.md for your role and instructions.\\n\\nVerify all citations in the literature review.\\n\\nMode: Audit bibliography\\n\\nReview file: GPD/literature/{slug}-REVIEW.md\\n\\nFor every reference listed in the Full Reference List and cited in the body:\\n1.

</spawn_contract>

**If the bibliographer agent fails to spawn or returns an error:** Treat the review as blocked until citation audit completes. Offer: 1) Retry citation audit, 2) Abort, 3) Return to the user with the review incomplete.

**If the bibliographer completed with issues recorded in the audit report:**

- Read the audit report
- Fix or remove hallucinated citations from the review document
- Update corrected metadata in the reference list
- Refresh `GPD/literature/{slug}-CITATION-SOURCES.json` so the sidecar stays aligned with the corrected review and reference keys.
- Re-run or refresh `GPD/literature/{slug}-CITATION-AUDIT.md` if citation fixes changed the review or sidecar.
- Note unresolvable citations in the return summary

**If the bibliographer reports completed:** apply the citation-audit artifact
gate for `GPD/literature/{slug}-CITATION-AUDIT.md` before continuing.

After the corrected sidecar passes, emit locator-only evidence; merge scoped
claim evidence only when the reviewer produced it:

```bash
CLAIM_EVIDENCE_ARGS=()
if [ -f "GPD/literature/{slug}-CLAIM-EVIDENCE.json" ]; then
  CLAIM_EVIDENCE_ARGS=(--claim-evidence "GPD/literature/{slug}-CLAIM-EVIDENCE.json")
fi
gpd --raw evidence literature \
  "GPD/literature/{slug}-CITATION-SOURCES.json" \
  "${CLAIM_EVIDENCE_ARGS[@]}" \
  --output "GPD/literature/{slug}-EVIDENCE.json"
```

Malformed sources or orphan links make the handoff incomplete; never inline
paper bodies in the bundle.
