<workflow_goal>
Explain a requested physics concept rigorously and in context. The command supports project-backed explanations and standalone explanations only when the standalone request already names an explicit target.
</workflow_goal>

<step name="validate_context">
Run centralized command-context preflight first.

```bash
CONTEXT=$(gpd --raw validate command-context explain "$ARGUMENTS")
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "$CONTEXT"
  exit 1
fi
```

Parse the returned JSON.

Load and follow `{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/results/result-lookup-policy.md` whenever canonical result-registry lookup is needed.

- If `project_exists=true`, operate in project-context mode. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask one focused question to identify the concept, result, method, notation, or paper to explain before continuing.
- If `project_exists=false`, require an explicit concept/topic from `$ARGUMENTS` and operate in standalone mode. Do not promise that an empty standalone launch can be clarified later; centralized preflight should reject it.
- If the request is non-empty but too vague to explain meaningfully, ask one clarifying question.
- If structured citation-source fields are present in init payloads, treat them as the preferred paper catalog for follow-up links and reference IDs.
- If the concept maps to a canonical stored result, apply the shared result lookup policy before dependency tracing.
</step>

<step name="scope_request">
Determine what kind of explanation is needed.

1. Extract the core concept, method, notation, result, or paper title from `$ARGUMENTS` or from the focused clarification answer collected in project-context mode.
2. Infer the likely explanation goal:
   - Conceptual grounding for the active phase
   - Formal clarification of notation/equations
   - Method comparison before or during execution
   - Paper/context briefing
3. Choose the right depth:
   - Brief operational clarification if the request is narrow and local
   - Full conceptual + formal explanation if the request is broader or foundational
4. Generate a slug for the output file from the concept.
5. If structured citation-source metadata is available, prefer it over prose-only reference reconstruction when selecting papers to mention or link.
6. If the explanation needs canonical stored-result context, apply the shared result lookup policy.

**Important:** Do not default to a generic textbook exposition. The explanation must answer why this matters in the user's current workflow or requested standalone task.
</step>

<step name="gather_project_context">
If project context exists, gather the minimum useful context packet before spawning the explainer.

```bash
INIT=$(gpd --raw init progress --include project,state,roadmap,config --no-project-reentry)
```

Use the init payload to extract:

- Project title / milestone
- Current phase and next phase
- Whether work is paused or currently executing
- Research mode, autonomy mode, and model profile
- Any structured citation-source catalog fields such as `citation_source_files`, `citation_source_count`, and `derived_citation_sources`
- Any manuscript-local reference status surfaced as `derived_manuscript_reference_status` when the explanation is about the active paper or manuscript
- Canonical stored-result metadata plus direct, upstream, or downstream context gathered with the shared result lookup policy when the concept maps to `intermediate_results`

Search the local workspace for relevant mentions of the requested concept:

```bash
rg -n -i --fixed-strings -- "{concept}" GPD paper manuscript docs src 2>/dev/null | head -60
```

Also check for nearby high-value context when present:

- `GPD/research-map/*.md`
- Current phase `PLAN.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `RESEARCH.md`, `VERIFICATION.md`
- `paper/`, `manuscript/`, or `draft/`
- Existing `GPD/literature/*REVIEW.md`
- Existing `GPD/literature/*-CITATION-SOURCES.json`
- Existing manuscript-local `BIBLIOGRAPHY-AUDIT.json` when available
- Existing canonical result entries and dependency context gathered with the shared result lookup policy

If no project context exists, gather only the user request plus any relevant local files in the current working directory.

Keep all GPD-authored explanation artifacts rooted under `GPD/explanations/` in the current workspace. In project-context mode, that means the resolved project root's `GPD/explanations/`; in standalone mode, it means `./GPD/explanations/` in the invoking workspace.

Create the output directory:

```bash
mkdir -p GPD/explanations
```
</step>

<step name="spawn_explainer">
Resolve the cognitive route and compatible explainer model:

```bash
COGNITIVE_PROFILE=$(gpd --raw config get cognitive_profile 2>/dev/null | gpd json get .value --default classic 2>/dev/null || echo "classic")
EXPLAINER_MODEL=$(gpd resolve-model gpd-explainer)
```

- Under `base-model-first`, the current main model writes the explanation from
  the same prompt below so it can retain the active conceptual and notation
  context.
- Use a fresh `gpd-explainer` under `classic`, when the user explicitly asks
  for fresh isolation, or when measured context pressure requires it. Record
  the concrete trigger; do not spawn merely because an explainer role exists.
- The route does not change the artifact structure, rigor, literature
  requirements, or citation-audit gate. The bibliographer remains a fresh
  independent audit on every route.

```markdown
<objective>
Explain the following concept rigorously and in context: {concept}
</objective>

<mode>
{project-context or standalone}
</mode>

<available_context>
- User request: {raw request}
- Project summary / roadmap / state excerpts when available
- Current phase, manuscript, or active process context when available
- Relevant local files and `rg` hits mentioning the concept
- Local conventions and notation artifacts when available
</available_context>

<requirements>
1. Start with the short answer in one paragraph.
2. Explain why this concept matters in the current project or requested task.
3. Build a prerequisite ladder so the explanation is scoped correctly.
4. Give the rigorous core: definition, physical meaning, assumptions, limits, and equations/derivation where needed.
5. Connect the concept to this project's files, conventions, current phase, or manuscript claims when available.
6. Distinguish established literature facts from project-specific assumptions or interpretations.
7. If structured citation-source metadata is available, use it to keep the literature guide tied to stable `reference_id` entries and openable URLs.
8. If canonical stored-result context is available, use the direct, dependency, or impact context gathered by the shared result lookup policy.
9. Include a literature guide with papers the user can open directly. Prefer arXiv abstract links when available; otherwise use DOI or INSPIRE links.
10. Never fabricate citations. If a reference is uncertain, mark it clearly as unverified instead of guessing.
11. Close with common confusions, failure modes, and the next questions the user should ask.
</requirements>

For the ordinary `base-model-first` route, execute `filled_prompt` in the
current main context and write `GPD/explanations/{slug}-EXPLAIN.md` directly.
Then continue to citation verification; do not invent a child id or typed
child return for this route.

For a fresh-context route:

```
task(
  prompt=filled_prompt,
  subagent_type="gpd-explainer",
  model="{explainer_model}",
  readonly=false,
  description="Explain {slug}"
)
```
</step>

<step name="verify_citations">
After the explanation is written, run the bibliographer on the produced explanation file.

Resolve bibliographer model:

```bash
BIBLIO_MODEL=$(gpd resolve-model gpd-bibliographer)
```

Apply the canonical runtime delegation convention already loaded above.

```
task(
  subagent_type="gpd-bibliographer",
  model="{biblio_model}",
  readonly=false,
  prompt="First, read {GPD_AGENTS_DIR}/gpd-bibliographer.md for your role and instructions.

Audit the citations in `GPD/explanations/{slug}-EXPLAIN.md`.

For every paper or book in the Literature Guide:
1. Verify that the reference is real and relevant
2. Check title, authors, year, journal/arXiv metadata, and openable URL
3. Flag hallucinated, inaccurate, or weakly supported references
4. Write the audit to `GPD/explanations/{slug}-CITATION-AUDIT.md`

Return a typed `gpd_return` envelope. Use `status: completed` when the audit finished, even if the human-readable heading is `## CITATION ISSUES FOUND`; use `status: checkpoint` only when researcher input is required to continue."
)
```

If the bibliographer completed with issues recorded in the audit report:

- Read the audit report
- Correct metadata in the explanation file where the fix is straightforward
- Remove or explicitly flag unresolved references
- Preserve the explanation, but never leave fabricated citations unmarked

If the bibliographer step fails entirely:

- Keep the explanation
- Set citation status to unverified in the final report
- Tell the user which file still needs manual checking
