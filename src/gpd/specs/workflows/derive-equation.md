<purpose>
Perform a rigorous physics derivation with explicit assumptions, locked
conventions, checkable algebra, decisive physics checks, and honest persistence.

For sustained analytical work or derivation recovery, read
`{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/research/long-derivation.md`.


<core_principle>
A derivation is a proof chain from stated assumptions to a stated result. Expose the operation, conventions and approximation domain at major steps.
Place decisive checks where a concrete failure mode or downstream dependency
makes them informative; do not require a new check after every algebraic step. Intuition may motivate the route; it does not certify
the result.
</core_principle>

<references>
Use `{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/analysis/physics-validation-recipes.md` when
executing detailed dimensional, limiting-case, symmetry, numerical spot-check,
and common-pitfall recipes. Do not eager-load that reference before the target
and proof-bearing status are known.

<derivation_standards>
- State assumptions, definitions, conventions, and starting point before
  algebra.
- Include `ASSERT_CONVENTION` in the document header and in convention-sensitive
  derivation steps.
- Name each major operation and show enough intermediate algebra to verify it.
- Justify approximations with the neglected term, validity parameter, and error
  scale.
- Keep dimensions, known limits, symmetries, and complex/algebraic spot-checks
  visible as decisive checks.
- Box the final expression and state validity domain, interpretation, and links
  to known or prior results.

<step name="load_context">
Load current-workspace state and conventions. This workflow may run as a
standalone/current-workspace analysis, so bootstrap must not auto-reenter an
ancestor or recent project.

```bash
INIT=$(gpd --raw init progress --include state,config --no-project-reentry)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd initialization failed: $INIT"
  # STOP; surface the error.
fi
```

Parse `workspace_root`, `project_root`, `state_exists`, `current_phase`,
`convention_lock`, `derived_convention_lock`, and continuation/runtime fields.
Treat phase context as authoritative only when the bootstrap surfaces a concrete phase number and phase directory. Do not synthesize a phase-local output path from an ancestor project root or an unverified phase guess.

If project state exists, inspect conventions, active approximations, validity
ranges, prior notation, and `intermediate_results`; inspect `intermediate_results` before re-deriving. Check existing canonical equation/result entries related to the target. Use `gpd result search` to locate the canonical result first; once a canonical `result_id` is known, use `gpd result show "{result_id}"` for the direct stored-result view before deciding whether a fresh derivation is needed. If state exists but phase context is not authoritative, keep background visible but write under `GPD/analysis/` and skip registry persistence.

Run convention verification before deriving when a project exists:

```bash
CONV_CHECK=$(gpd --raw convention check 2>/dev/null)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Convention verification failed — review before deriving"
  echo "$CONV_CHECK"
fi
```
</step>

<step name="state_problem">
Write the derivation objective before calculating:

```markdown
## Derivation Objective

**Goal:** Derive [expression/relation/equation] for [system/quantity].
**Starting point:** [Given Lagrangian/Hamiltonian/action/equation]
**Known constraints:** [Established expression, symmetry or dimensional constraints; unknown results remain unknown]
**Initial method:** [Candidate route and unresolved obstacles; revise within scope as evidence develops]
```
</step>

<step name="proof_obligation_screen">
Proof-bearing derivations fail closed. If the objective is theorem-style or
contract-backed `proof_obligation` work, proof review is mandatory before the
result can be treated as established.

@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/verification/core/proof-redteam-workflow-gate.md

For proof-bearing derivations, carry this theorem inventory through the
document:

```markdown
## Proof Inventory

- **Claim / theorem target:** [exact statement being proved]
- **Named parameters:** [symbol -> role / domain]
- **Hypotheses:** [H1, H2, ...]
- **Quantifier / domain obligations:** [for all x in ..., exists y such that ...]
- **Conclusion clauses:** [what the proof must establish]
```

Reserve the sibling proof-redteam artifact:

- **Phase-scoped:** `${phase_dir}/DERIVATION-{slug}-PROOF-REDTEAM.md`
- **Standalone:** `GPD/analysis/derivation-{slug}-proof-redteam.md`

`gpd-check-proof` is the canonical owner of that audit whenever runtime
delegation is available. If delegation is unavailable, stop at a checkpoint
rather than self-certifying theorem-proof alignment in the writer context.
</step>

<step name="establish_framework">
Write numbered assumptions, definitions, conventions, and the starting point.
If a project convention lock exists, every declared convention must match it; a
drift is a hard stop until corrected through `gpd convention set` or by using
the locked convention.

```markdown
## Assumptions

A1. [Physical assumption]: [justification and validity regime]
A2. [Mathematical assumption]: [failure mode]

## Definitions

| Symbol | Meaning | Dimensions | Defined by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {symbol} | {name} | {[dimensions]} | {equation or convention} |

## Conventions

<!-- ASSERT_CONVENTION: natural_units={from lock}, metric_signature={from lock}, fourier_convention={from lock} -->

## Starting Point

[Expression with indices, factors, source, and dimensional check.]
```
</step>

<step name="derive_step_by_step">
For each major operation:

1. Name the operation: variation, integration by parts, expansion, saddle
   approximation, series sum, analytic continuation, basis projection, etc.
2. Show the key algebra with enough context that a physicist can verify it.
3. Record convention assertions where signs, normalization or definitions change.
4. At consequential transitions, choose checks that test the actual risk;
   reuse still-applicable evidence instead of repeating dimensions/limits/symmetry
   after each operation.
5. For approximations, state the neglected terms, the controlling parameter,
   and the leading error scale.

If any convention assertion differs from Step 1 or from the project lock, stop
immediately and resolve the drift before combining results.
</step>

<step name="verify_intermediate">
At natural sub-calculation boundaries, run decisive checks:

- dimensional consistency;
- known or simple limiting cases;
- symmetry preservation or covariance;
- numerical spot-checks for algebraically complex equations;
- cross-phase consistency when combining prior results.

For detailed check recipes and pitfall prompts, load
`{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/analysis/physics-validation-recipes.md`. When
combining prior results, re-read the prior `ASSERT_CONVENTION` lines and run
`gpd --raw convention check 2>/dev/null` if the project has a convention lock.
</step>

<step name="state_result">
State the final result with:

```markdown
## Result

Under assumptions A1-A{N}, the [quantity] is

$$
\boxed{[final expression]}
$$

**Dimensions:** [verified]
**Regime of validity:** [where this holds]
**Interpretation:** [physical meaning]
**Limiting cases verified:** [table or bullets]
**Connection to known results:** [known reductions or extensions]
```
</step>

<step name="document_derivation">
Write a self-contained derivation artifact with frontmatter, objective,
assumptions, definitions, conventions, starting point, derivation, result,
verification, error analysis, and references.

Save to:

- **Phase-scoped (authoritative phase context only):** `${phase_dir}/DERIVATION-{slug}.md`
- **Current-workspace fallback (standalone or no authoritative phase context):** `GPD/analysis/derivation-{slug}.md`

Create `GPD/analysis/` only for the fallback branch:

```bash
mkdir -p GPD/analysis
```

For proof-bearing work, reserve the sibling audit path listed in
`proof_obligation_screen`. Do not have the derivation writer self-author that
audit. If any named parameter, hypothesis, quantifier, or conclusion clause is
uncovered, `gpd-check-proof` must set `status: gaps_found` and the derivation
must not describe the theorem as established.

Resolve the proof-critic model and spawn the independent critic:

```bash
CHECK_PROOF_MODEL=$(gpd resolve-model gpd-check-proof)
```

@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/orchestration/runtime-delegation-note.md

```
task(
  subagent_type="gpd-check-proof",
  model="{check_proof_model}",
  readonly=false,
  prompt="First, read {GPD_AGENTS_DIR}/gpd-check-proof.md for your role and instructions.
Then read {GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/templates/proof-redteam-schema.md and {GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/verification/core/proof-redteam-protocol.md.
Operate in proof-redteam mode with a fresh context.
Follow the proof-redteam protocol's one-shot return semantics.

Write to:

Read the derivation artifact, theorem inventory, relevant PLAN/contract context, and supporting verification artifacts. Audit the exact theorem text, not a paraphrase. Fail closed on missing parameter coverage, hidden assumptions, or narrower special-case proofs sold as general claims.",
  description="Proof redteam for derivation {slug}"
)
```
</step>

<step name="persist_result">
Persist only project-backed, authoritative phase results through the executable
bridge:

```bash
gpd result persist-derived --id "{result_id}" --derivation-slug "{derivation_slug}" --equation "{final_equation}" --description "{short description}" --phase "{phase}" --validity "{validity}" [--depends-on "{comma-separated ids}"]
```

If no stable `result_id` is available yet, omit `--id` and let the bridge derive
one from slug plus phase. Re-check `intermediate_results` and exact equation or
description matches before creating a duplicate. If the bridge reports multiple
matches, stop and disambiguate.

Read bridge output carefully: `requested_result_id` is the requested stable ID,
`result_id` is the actual canonical entry, and
`requested_result_redirected=true` means the canonical anchor differs from the
requested derivation-oriented ID. Carry the actual `result_id` forward for
continuation and later reruns. If the bridge reports multiple matches, stop and
disambiguate.

If `state_exists` is true but authoritative phase context is missing, skip
registry write-back and keep the artifact under `GPD/analysis/`. If
`state_exists` is false, skip registry write-back and do not invent project
state. If the bridge returns `status=skipped` with
`reason=no_recoverable_project_state`, treat it as the standalone branch.
