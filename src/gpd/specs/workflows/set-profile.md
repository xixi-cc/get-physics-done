<process>

This is an action workflow. Execute the validation and update steps; do not only explain profile options or summarize the selected mode.

<step name="validate">
Parse and validate the raw single profile argument:

```bash
PROFILE="$(printf '%s' "$ARGUMENTS" | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//')"
case "$PROFILE" in
  deep-theory|numerical|exploratory|review|paper-writing) ;;
  "")
    echo "ERROR: Missing profile. Valid profiles: deep-theory, numerical, exploratory, review, paper-writing"
    exit 1
    ;;
  *[[:space:]]*)
    echo "ERROR: set-profile accepts exactly one profile argument."
    exit 1
    ;;
  *)
    echo "ERROR: Invalid profile \"$PROFILE\". Valid profiles: deep-theory, numerical, exploratory, review, paper-writing"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

</step>

<step name="ensure_and_load_config">
Ensure config exists without initializing or mutating project state:

```bash
gpd config ensure-section
```

This creates or repairs the config section only. Do not run `gpd init`, `gpd progress`, state sync, or project reentry from `set-profile`; this command is allowed to change only `GPD/config.json::model_profile`.
</step>

<step name="update_config">
Update only the `model_profile` field through the config CLI, preserving all other `GPD/config.json` keys:

```bash
gpd config set model_profile "$PROFILE"
```
</step>

<step name="confirm">
Display confirmation with profile details for selected profile:

```
Profile set to: $PROFILE

Agents will now operate in this mode:

[Show profile details for selected profile]

**Profile definitions:**

Canonical per-agent tier assignments live in `MODEL_PROFILES` and the installed reference `references/orchestration/model-profiles.md`. Do not copy the agent/tier matrix here; use that reference when exact tier rows are needed.

**deep-theory**
Focus: Rigorous analytical derivations, formal proofs, exact results

Best for: Deriving new results, proving identities, establishing exact relations, formal perturbation theory, renormalization group calculations.

Behavioral highlights: Tier-1 planner and executor preserve maximum derivational depth, explicit assumptions, exact reasoning, controlled approximations, and local dimensional/sign/index/limit/convention checks. These checks stay inside the coherent derivation instead of forcing user-facing checkpoints after each algebraic step. Independent agents and bounded stops remain controlled separately by `workflow.*` policy and `execution.review_cadence`. Use `workflow.*="auto"` with sparse cadence for daily theory construction; request dense cadence and always-on agents for a formal audit. Paper-writer includes proofs in main text, and debugging retains formal root-cause depth.

**numerical**
Focus: Computational implementation, optimization, convergence, performance

Best for: Implementing solvers, running simulations, optimizing code, convergence studies, parallelization, data pipeline construction.

Behavioral highlights: Convergence testing task added to every numerical computation. Grid/basis/timestep refinement required before results accepted. Richardson extrapolation automatic. Plan-checker emphasizes numerical stability and error budgets. `execution.review_cadence` stays independent; `dense` is the default, giving frequent review gates; drop to `adaptive` when you want a lighter cadence.

**exploratory**
Focus: Rapid prototyping, hypothesis testing, parameter space exploration

Best for: Early-stage investigation, scanning parameter spaces, testing new ideas, order-of-magnitude estimates, dimensional analysis, building intuition.

Behavioral highlights: 3-4 tasks per plan, larger tasks (up to 90 min), only final results verified (skips intermediate checkpoints). Plan-checker uses the exploratory subset of its dimension matrix. Quick-triage debugging (max 2 rounds). Verifier runs only dimensional analysis + limiting cases + spot-checks + plausibility. Use `execution.review_cadence=sparse` or `adaptive` if you want fewer bounded review stops, but required correctness gates still remain.

**review** (default)
Focus: Critical assessment, error checking, literature comparison

Best for: Pre-submission review, debugging wrong results, resolving discrepancies, preparing referee responses, validating collaborator work.

Behavioral highlights: Exhaustive debugging documentation. All verifier checks run plus cross-validation against 2+ literature values. Plan-checker runs its full dimension matrix plus testability checks. Every step cross-references the literature source it implements. This profile often benefits from `execution.review_cadence=dense`, but cadence remains a separate setting.

**paper-writing**
Focus: Clear exposition, LaTeX production, figure generation, narrative flow

Best for: Writing manuscripts, preparing talks, generating figures, formatting for journal submission, writing supplementary material.

Behavioral highlights: Plans organized by paper sections with tasks mapped to figures, tables, and equations. Narrative-focused execution with clean intermediate expressions. Publication-readiness verification (figures match data, notation consistent, all symbols defined). The full plan-checker dimension matrix is checked with emphasis on publication readiness. Full BibTeX formatting against target journal style. Rapid first drafts with multiple revision passes. Keep `execution.review_cadence=dense` for publication-quality passes; use `adaptive` or `sparse` only for bounded editorial polish where correctness gates are already satisfied. Cadence is not profile-owned.

---

**Review cadence interaction:**

`set-profile` changes abstract tier assignments and behavior depth. It does NOT rewrite `execution.review_cadence`.

- `dense` (default): forces first-result and pre-fanout gates on every wave, regardless of risk classifier
- `adaptive`: injects first-result and risky-fanout gates only when the classifier marks the wave risky
- `sparse`: fewest bounded review stops beyond the required correctness gates

Change cadence with `gpd:settings` or by editing `GPD/config.json` (`execution.review_cadence`: `"dense"` / `"adaptive"` / `"sparse"`).

If you also want to pin concrete runtime model strings for `tier-1`, `tier-2`, or `tier-3`, use `gpd:set-tier-models` for the direct path or `gpd:settings` for the broader unattended/configuration flow. `set-profile` changes the abstract tier assignments, not the runtime-native model IDs.

For full agent tier assignments across all 20 agents, see `references/orchestration/model-profiles.md`.
For detailed behavioral effect descriptions per agent per profile, see the "Behavioral Effects" section in `references/orchestration/model-profiles.md`.

Next spawned agents will use the new profile.
