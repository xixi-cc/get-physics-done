This file is an index only. Do not load this index as a stage authority; load
only the stage map here, then enter `session_router`. Stage ownership, status
vocabulary, produced state, allowed tools, writes, and routing are
manifest/stage-owned by `verify-work-stage-manifest.json` and the files below:

- `session_router`: `workflows/verify-work/session-router.md`
- `phase_bootstrap`: `workflows/verify-work/phase-bootstrap.md`
- `inventory_build`: `workflows/verify-work/inventory-build.md`
- `interactive_validation`: `workflows/verify-work/interactive-validation.md`
- `gap_repair`: `workflows/verify-work/gap-repair.md`
