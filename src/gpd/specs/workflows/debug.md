<purpose>
Diagnose research problems in the current main context when continuity is useful,
or orchestrate parallel investigation agents when isolation or fanout is useful.

After verification finds issues, spawn one investigation agent per issue. Each agent investigates independently with symptoms pre-filled from verification. Collect root causes, update `VERIFICATION.md` gaps with diagnosis, then hand off to `plan-phase --gaps` with actual diagnoses.

Research problems include: calculation errors, numerical instabilities, theoretical inconsistencies, missing physics, wrong approximations, sign errors, convergence failures, unphysical results.

The route changes who performs the investigation, not the evidence, session-file,
typed-return, approval, or verification-update contract.
</purpose>

<mode_detection>

## Mode Detection

Check invocation context:
- **If called by verify-work** (batch mode): Process all gaps from VERIFICATION.md in parallel. Use `DEBUG-{slug}.md` naming. Return to verify-work.
- **If called by user** (interactive mode): Single issue investigation. Use `{slug}.md` naming. Interactive loop with user.

Detection: If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--batch` or if `gaps_from_verification` context exists, use batch mode.

**Batch mode:** Parse all gaps from VERIFICATION.md, spawn parallel agents, collect results, update VERIFICATION.md, return to caller.

**Interactive mode:** Present issue to user, investigate interactively, create debug session file, offer next steps.

<quick_triage>

## Quick Triage

Before full investigation, match the discrepancy signature against common patterns:

| Signature | Most Likely Cause | First Check |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Factor of 2 | Spin/identical particle symmetrization, missing 1/2 | Check particle statistics |
| Factor of 2pi | Fourier convention mismatch | Check FT convention in CONVENTIONS.md |
| Factor of 4pi | Gaussian vs SI units | Check unit system |
| Sign flip | Metric convention, time-ordering sign | Check metric signature |
| Wrong power law | Dimension error, wrong scaling limit | Dimensional analysis |
| Off by order of magnitude | Unit conversion error | Track units step-by-step |
| Complex when should be real | Wrong branch cut, missing hermitian conjugate | Check analytic structure |
| Divergent/infinite result | Missing regularization, zero mode, wrong contour | Check regularization scheme |
| Non-conservation (energy, charge) | Missing connection terms, wrong operator ordering | Verify continuity equations |
| Violates known bound | Normalization error, missing factors (variational E < E_exact, P > 1) | Check normalization and known limits |
| Wrong symmetry properties | Missing anomaly, wrong topological term, path-ordering | Verify transformation under P, T, gauge |
| Wrong temperature dependence | Classical/quantum conflation, wrong ensemble | Check quantum crossover scale |
| Negative spectral weight | Wrong Green's function type, complex conjugation error | Verify spectral positivity and KMS relation |

If the discrepancy matches a common pattern, test that hypothesis FIRST before entering the full investigation loop. This resolves ~50% of issues immediately.

<core_principle>
**Diagnose before planning fixes.**

Validation tells us WHAT is wrong (symptoms). Investigation agents find WHY (root cause). plan-phase --gaps then creates targeted fixes based on actual causes, not guesses.

Without diagnosis: "Energy not conserved" -> guess at fix -> maybe wrong
With diagnosis: "Energy not conserved" -> "Symplectic integrator replaced with forward Euler in refactor" -> precise fix

Without diagnosis: "Result disagrees with literature" -> "redo calculation" -> wasted effort
With diagnosis: "Result disagrees with literature" -> "Missing factor of 2 from spin degeneracy in density of states" -> targeted correction
</core_principle>

<process>

<step name="route_mode">
**Route before loading evidence:**

- Interactive mode (direct user invocation): do not parse `VERIFICATION.md`. Run `gpd --raw init progress --include state,roadmap,config --no-project-reentry`, list active `GPD/debug/*.md` sessions when `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, gather the missing symptom fields with `ask_user`, and route one diagnosis-only investigation as described below.
- Batch mode (verify-work handoff): parse `VERIFICATION.md` gaps and spawn one diagnosis-only `gpd-debugger` per gap.

Interactive symptom fields: expected result, actual result, discrepancy character, parameter/regime where it breaks, and checks already tried. If an active session is resumed, the continuation prompt points the child to `GPD/debug/{slug}.md`; do not inline an `@GPD/debug/{slug}.md` attachment.

Interactive typed-return handling:

- `gpd_return.status: completed` -- verify `GPD/debug/{slug}.md`, present the evidence-backed root cause, and offer: Fix now, Plan fix, Manual fix.
- `gpd_return.status: checkpoint` -- present the checkpoint, collect the user response, and spawn a fresh continuation that first reads the session file.
- `gpd_return.status: blocked` or `failed` -- show what was checked and offer: Continue investigating, Manual investigation, Add more context, Simplify the problem.
</step>

<step name="parse_gaps">
**Batch mode: extract gaps from VERIFICATION.md:**

Read the "Gaps" section (YAML format):

```yaml
- expectation: "Energy is conserved to machine precision"
  status: failed
  reason: "Researcher reported: energy drifts by 1% over 1000 timesteps"
  severity: major
  check: 2
  missing: []
```

For each gap, also read the corresponding check from "Checks" section to get full context.

Build gap list:

```
gaps = [
  {expectation: "Energy is conserved...", severity: "major", check_num: 2, reason: "..."},
  {expectation: "Critical temperature matches literature...", severity: "blocker", check_num: 5, reason: "..."},
  ...
]
```

</step>

<step name="report_plan">
**Report diagnosis plan to researcher:**

```
## Diagnosing {N} Research Issues

Spawning parallel investigation agents to find root causes:

| Issue (Expected Outcome) | Severity |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Energy is conserved to machine precision | major |
| Critical temperature matches Tc/J = 4.51 | blocker |
| Spectral function satisfies sum rule | major |

Each agent will:
1. Create DEBUG-{slug}.md with symptoms pre-filled
2. Investigate independently (read code/derivations, form hypotheses, test)
3. Return root cause

This runs in parallel - all issues investigated simultaneously.
```

</step>

<step name="spawn_agents">
**Resolve debugger model and mode settings:**

```bash
DEBUGGER_MODEL=$(gpd resolve-model gpd-debugger)
AUTONOMY=$(gpd --raw config get autonomy 2>/dev/null | gpd json get .value --default supervised 2>/dev/null || echo "supervised")
COGNITIVE_PROFILE=$(gpd --raw config get cognitive_profile 2>/dev/null | gpd json get .value --default base-model-first 2>/dev/null || echo "base-model-first")
```

**Choose the cognitive route before dispatch:**

- Under `base-model-first`, an ordinary single interactive issue is diagnosed
  by the current main model so it can retain the live physical context.
- Use a fresh `gpd-debugger` under `classic`, for batch/parallel diagnosis, when
  the user explicitly requests independent isolation, or when measured context
  pressure requires a fresh context. Record the concrete trigger; do not spawn
  merely because a debugger role exists.
- Both routes use the same filled investigation prompt, triage table,
  `GPD/debug/{slug}.md` session artifact, root-cause-only scope, typed
  `gpd_return`, checkpoint behavior, and downstream verification update.

**Mode-aware behavior:**
- `autonomy=supervised` (default): Pause after each debugger agent returns findings. Present the diagnosis to the user before proceeding to a fix.
- `autonomy=balanced`: Spawn the debugger agents, collect findings, and apply routine fixes automatically. Pause only if there are multiple plausible root causes or the fix changes assumptions or scope.
- `autonomy=yolo`: Spawn debuggers and continue automatically only after a specific evidence-backed root cause is identified. Do not apply a merely plausible fix.

**Run the investigation:**

For the ordinary interactive `base-model-first` route, execute the filled
debug subagent prompt in the current main context. Write the same session file
and produce the same typed return envelope. Do not self-promote a plausible
hypothesis to a root cause: the evidence threshold below is unchanged.

For a fresh-context route, spawn investigation agents in parallel:

For each gap, fill the debug subagent prompt template (see `{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/templates/debug-subagent-prompt.md` for the full template with placeholders, continuation format, and failure protocol) and spawn:
@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/orchestration/runtime-delegation-note.md

> Apply the canonical runtime delegation convention already loaded above.

```
task(
  prompt="First, read {GPD_AGENTS_DIR}/gpd-debugger.md for your role and instructions.\n\n" + filled_investigation_subagent_prompt,
  subagent_type="gpd-debugger",
  model="{debugger_model}",
  readonly=false,
  description="Investigate: {truth_short}"
)
```

**If any debugger agent fails to spawn or returns an error:** Continue with remaining agents. A single failed agent does not invalidate other investigations. After all agents complete, report which investigations failed and offer: 1) Retry failed investigations, 2) Investigate the failed truths in the main context, 3) Proceed only with the evidence-backed root causes that were actually established while keeping unresolved gaps open.

**All agents spawn in single message** (parallel execution).

Template placeholders:

- `{truth}`: The expected physics outcome that failed
- `{expected}`: From validation check
- `{actual}`: Verbatim researcher description from reason field
- `{errors}`: Any error messages or numerical values from validation (or "None reported")
- `{reproduction}`: "Check {check_num} in validation"
- `{timeline}`: "Discovered during research validation"
- `{goal}`: `find_root_cause_only` (validation flow - plan-phase --gaps handles fixes)
- `{slug}`: Generated from truth

**Investigation strategies for physics problems:**

Each agent should consider these common root causes:

- **Sign errors:** Flipped sign in Hamiltonian term, wrong convention for Fourier transform, metric signature
- **Missing factors:** Factor of 2 from spin, factor of 2\*pi from Fourier conventions, degeneracy factors
- **Wrong approximation:** Approximation invalid in parameter regime being tested, higher-order terms needed
- **Numerical issues:** Insufficient resolution, wrong integrator, floating-point cancellation, ill-conditioned matrix
- **Implementation bugs:** Array indexing off-by-one, wrong variable in expression, copy-paste error
- **Conceptual errors:** Wrong physical picture, missing physics (e.g., forgot about exchange interaction)
- **Unit/convention mismatch:** Different conventions in different parts of code, missing conversion factors
- **Regularization/renormalization:** Scheme mixing (dim reg + cutoff), missing counterterms, wrong renormalization scale
- **Topological/global issues:** Missing anomalies (ABJ), wrong path ordering for non-Abelian fields, zero mode miscounting
- **Wrong regime:** Adiabatic vs sudden approximation, classical vs quantum statistics, wrong ensemble for system size
  </step>

<step name="collect_results">
**Collect root causes from the typed return envelope:**

Each agent returns one typed `gpd_return` envelope and points to `GPD/debug/{slug}.md` as the session file.

- If `gpd_return.status: completed`, read `gpd_return.session_file` and use the file-backed diagnosis as the authoritative root-cause record.
- If `gpd_return.status: checkpoint`, present the checkpoint details to the user and spawn a fresh continuation run.
- If `gpd_return.status: blocked` or `failed`, report what was checked and keep the investigation incomplete.
- Do not route on heading markers in the returned text; use the typed `gpd_return` envelope and the session file instead.
  </step>

<step name="update_validation">
**Update VERIFICATION.md gaps with diagnosis:**

For each gap in the Gaps section, record the diagnosis fields the verifier actually consumes: `root_cause`, `missing`, `physics_impact`, and `debug_session`. Keep the update focused on the diagnosis rather than restating artifact inventories or path lists.

Keep canonical verification `status` unchanged and set `session_status: diagnosed` in that verification frontmatter. The debug session file at `GPD/debug/{slug}.md` keeps the debug-session `status` lifecycle and does not use `session_status`.

Commit the updated VERIFICATION.md:

```bash
PRE_CHECK=$(gpd pre-commit-check --files "${phase_dir}/{phase}-VERIFICATION.md" 2>&1) || true
echo "$PRE_CHECK"

gpd commit "docs({phase}): add root causes from diagnosis" --files "${phase_dir}/{phase}-VERIFICATION.md"
```

**Agent fails to find root cause:**

- Mark gap as "needs expert review"
- Continue with other gaps
- Report incomplete diagnosis and keep the gap unresolved; do not generate a speculative fix plan for that gap

**Agent times out:**

- Check DEBUG-{slug}.md for partial progress
- Can resume with gpd:debug

**All agents fail:**

- Something systemic (environment, dependencies, etc.)
- Report for expert investigation
- Return blocked with the unresolved gaps and missing diagnostic evidence; do not fall back to plan-phase --gaps without root causes
