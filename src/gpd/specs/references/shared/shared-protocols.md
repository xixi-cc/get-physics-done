# Shared Protocols

Common protocols referenced by multiple GPD agents. Import via `references/shared/shared-protocols.md`.

Agents must NEVER install dependencies silently. Ask the user before any install attempt, including Python packages, CLI tools, and TeX distributions. If TeX is required and missing, the user may choose to install BasicTeX yourself (small macOS option, about 100MB) or use an environment that already has TeX.

## Epistemic Rigor Protocol

Default to scientific skepticism and critical thinking.

- Treat user preferences, prior notes, and model intuitions as hypotheses to test, not positions to oppose or conclusions to defend
- Look for missing anchors, disconfirming evidence, proxy success, and regime violations before endorsing a result
- Ground claims in inspected artifacts, executed checks, cited sources, or clearly labeled background knowledge
- If a required artifact, citation, benchmark, or source cannot be found, produced, verified, or reproduced, keep that gap explicit as missing, failed, blocked, or inconclusive
- Never fabricate references, numbers, derivations, files, figures, tables, logs, summaries, proofs, or claimed task completion
- Narrow the claim when evidence is partial; do not upgrade uncertainty into agreement

## Forbidden Files

**NEVER read or quote contents from these files (even if they exist):**

- `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env` -- Environment variables with secrets
- `credentials.*`, `secrets.*`, `*secret*`, `*credential*` -- Credential files
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.jks` -- Certificates and private keys
- `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `id_dsa*` -- SSH private keys
- `.npmrc`, `*.netrc` -- Package manager auth tokens
- `config/secrets/*`, `.secrets/*`, `secrets/` -- Secret directories
- `*.keystore`, `*.truststore` -- Java keystores
- `serviceAccountKey.json`, `*-credentials.json` -- Cloud service credentials
- Any file in `.gitignore` that appears to contain secrets

**Additional caution for physics projects:**

- Private experimental data under NDA or embargo
- Unpublished results from collaborators not yet cleared for sharing
- Referee reports and editorial correspondence
- Pre-publication manuscripts from other groups shared in confidence

**If you encounter these files:**

- Note their EXISTENCE only: "`.env` file present - contains environment configuration"
- NEVER quote their contents, even partially
- NEVER include values like `API_KEY=...` or `sk-...` in any output

**Why this matters:** Your output gets committed to git. Leaked secrets = security incident. Leaked embargoed data = collaboration violation.

## Convention Tracking Protocol

Physics calculations are invalidated by convention mismatches. Every agent working with equations must track conventions explicitly.

### Required Convention Declarations

Every phase, plan, or derivation must declare:

| Convention | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Unit system | natural (hbar=c=1), SI, CGS, lattice | natural |
| Metric signature | (+,-,-,-), (-,+,+,+), Euclidean (+,+,+,+) | (+,-,-,-) |
| Fourier convention | physics (exp(-iwt)), math (exp(+iwt)), QFT (exp(-ipx)) | physics |
| Index convention | Einstein summation, explicit sums | Einstein |
| State normalization | relativistic, non-relativistic | context-dependent |
| Spinor convention | Dirac, Weyl, Majorana | context-dependent |
| Gauge choice | Coulomb, Lorenz, axial, Feynman, light-cone | context-dependent |
| Commutator ordering | normal ordering, time ordering, Weyl ordering | context-dependent |
| Coupling convention | g, g^2, g^2/(4pi), alpha=g^2/(4pi) | context-dependent |
| Renormalization scheme | MS-bar, on-shell, momentum subtraction, lattice | context-dependent |

### Convention Lock

At the start of every task:

1. Read `convention_lock` from `state.json`; `STATE.md` is the readable state document
2. Read `conventions` from the plan frontmatter
3. If this task uses results from a prior plan: verify that prior plan's conventions match
4. State explicitly at the top of every derivation file which conventions are in effect

### Before Every Fourier Transform

State the sign convention and where the 2pi lives:

```
% Fourier convention: f(x) = integral dk/(2pi) f(k) e^{+ikx}
% Inverse:            f(k) = integral dx f(x) e^{-ikx}
% (physics convention with 2pi in the dk measure)
```

Different conventions differ by powers of 2pi and signs in the exponent. The three common ones are:

| Convention | Forward (x -> k)               | Inverse (k -> x)               | Where 2pi lives        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Physics    | integral dx e^{-ikx}           | integral dk/(2pi) e^{+ikx}     | In dk                  |
| Math       | integral dx e^{-2pi*i*kx}      | integral dk e^{+2pi*i*kx}      | Absorbed into exponent |
| Symmetric  | integral dx/sqrt(2pi) e^{-ikx} | integral dk/sqrt(2pi) e^{+ikx} | Split between both     |

**Always state which row you are using.**

### Before Every Metric Contraction

State the signature convention and verify:

```
% Metric: g = diag(+1, -1, -1, -1)
% Verification: g^{mu nu} g_{nu rho} = delta^mu_rho
% Implication: k^2 = k_mu k^mu = k_0^2 - |k|^2
% On-shell: k^2 = m^2 (positive)
```

If using (-,+,+,+): k^2 = -k_0^2 + |k|^2, and on-shell k^2 = -m^2. The propagator is 1/(k^2 + m^2) not 1/(k^2 - m^2). Getting this wrong flips signs everywhere.

### Before Every Commutator/Anticommutator

State the ordering convention:

- **Canonical commutation:** [x, p] = i\*hbar (or i in natural units). Sign and factor of hbar.
- **Creation/annihilation:** [a, a^dag] = 1 (bosons), {b, b^dag} = 1 (fermions)
- **Field commutators:** [phi(x), pi(y)] = i\*delta(x-y). State equal-time vs covariant.
- **Normal ordering:** : a^dag a : = a^dag a (no constant subtraction). But : a a^dag : = a^dag a (reordered).

### Automated Convention Enforcement

At the start of each task, agents MUST:

1. **Read `convention_lock`** from STATE.md/state.json and verify all conventions match the project lock
2. **Before every Fourier transform,** verify the sign convention matches the locked convention — state explicitly which row of the Fourier convention table is in use
3. **Before combining expressions from different sources,** run the 5-point checklist:
   - Metric signature matches? (check propagator sign)
   - Fourier convention matches? (check 2π placement)
   - State normalization matches? (check relativistic vs non-relativistic)
   - Coupling convention matches? (check g vs alpha = g^2/(4pi) — a factor of 4pi per vertex)
   - Renormalization scheme matches? (check MS-bar vs on-shell — finite parts differ)

If any check fails, resolve the mismatch BEFORE proceeding. Never combine and "fix later."

### Convention Conflict Detection

Before using any equation from an external source, verify:

1. **Metric signature** -- Does the source use the same signature? A propagator derived with (-,+,+,+) has opposite signs from one derived with (+,-,-,-).
2. **Fourier convention** -- Where does the 2pi live? Factors of 2pi are the #1 source of "factor of 2pi" discrepancies.
3. **Coupling constant definition** -- Is it g, g^2, g^2/(4pi), or alpha=g^2/(4pi)?
4. **Field normalization** -- Canonical vs relativistic normalization of states and fields.
5. **Renormalization scheme** -- MS-bar, on-shell, momentum subtraction? Intermediate quantities are scheme-dependent.

### When Combining Expressions from Different Sources

Before combining two expressions (e.g., a propagator from one derivation with a vertex from another):

1. **Verify unit systems match.** Both in natural units? Both in SI? If mixed: convert explicitly.
2. **Verify metric signatures match.** Both (+,-,-,-)? If not: do not combine. Convert one first.
3. **Verify Fourier conventions match.** Same sign in exponent? Same placement of 2pi? If not: insert the conversion factor.
4. **Verify state normalizations match.** Both relativistic (<p|q> = (2pi)^3 2E delta)? Both non-relativistic (<p|q> = delta)? The cross section formula depends on this.
5. **Verify coupling conventions match.** Both using the same definition of the coupling? g vs g^2/(4pi) vs alpha introduces factors of 4pi at every vertex. If different: convert explicitly.
6. **Verify renormalization schemes match.** Both MS-bar? Both on-shell? Intermediate quantities (counterterms, anomalous dimensions, finite parts) are scheme-dependent. Mixing schemes silently produces wrong finite parts.
7. **Document the verification.** "Propagator from theory.tex uses (+,-,-,-) and physics Fourier convention. Vertex from vertex.tex uses same. Coupling: both use alpha_s = g^2/(4pi) in MS-bar. Compatible --- combining directly."

If any mismatch is found: resolve it BEFORE combining. Never combine and "fix later."

### Convention Propagation Rules

- If Phase 01 established metric (+,-,-,-), ALL subsequent phases MUST use it unless an explicit convention change task is included
- When citing results from sources with different conventions, convert BEFORE using
- Document all convention choices in project CONVENTIONS.md
- When ambiguity is possible, annotate each equation with its convention

### Cross-Phase Error Propagation

When a phase consumes results from a prior phase, uncertainties must be tracked explicitly:

1. **Identify inputs from prior phases.** List every quantity imported from a previous phase with its uncertainty or error estimate.
2. **Propagate uncertainties.** Use standard error propagation (quadrature for independent errors, linear for correlated errors) through every calculation step that uses imported quantities.
3. **Document propagation.** In the phase SUMMARY, include a section listing: (a) imported quantities with their uncertainties, (b) how uncertainties entered the current calculation, (c) the resulting uncertainty on this phase's outputs.
4. **Flag amplification.** If uncertainty is amplified (e.g., exponentiation, division by small numbers, chaotic sensitivity), flag this explicitly as a potential validity concern.
5. **Use `gpd:error-propagation`** for systematic tracking across multi-phase calculations.

**Why this matters:** Without explicit tracking, error bars on final results are underestimated. A 5% uncertainty in Phase 2 can become 50% by Phase 6 through amplification, but if never tracked, the final result appears precise.

### Machine-Readable Convention Assertions

Every derivation file must include a parseable assertion line declaring which conventions are in effect. Convention-sensitive computation scripts and notebooks should also include one when they are meant to be reused or audited later. This enables automated verification by the consistency checker, verifier, and pre-commit gate.

**Syntax:**

```
% ASSERT_CONVENTION: key=value, key=value, ...
```

For LaTeX files, use `%` comment prefix. For Python, use `#`. For Markdown, use an HTML comment `<!-- ASSERT_CONVENTION: ... -->`.

**Required keys** (must match convention_lock key names from `gpd convention list`):

| Key | Values | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `natural_units` | `natural`, `SI`, `CGS`, `lattice` | `natural_units=natural` |
| `metric_signature` | `mostly-plus`, `mostly-minus`, `euclidean` | `metric_signature=mostly-plus` |
| `fourier_convention` | `physics`, `math`, `symmetric` | `fourier_convention=physics` |
| `coupling_convention` | `g`, `g^2/(4pi)`, `alpha=g^2/(4pi)`, or explicit | `coupling_convention=alpha=g^2/(4pi)` |
| `renormalization_scheme` | `MSbar`, `on-shell`, `MOM`, `lattice` | `renormalization_scheme=MSbar` |
| `state_normalization` | `relativistic`, `non-relativistic` | `state_normalization=relativistic` |
| `gauge_choice` | `Feynman`, `Lorenz`, `Coulomb`, `axial`, `light-cone` | `gauge_choice=Feynman` |
| `time_ordering` | `normal`, `time`, `Weyl` | `time_ordering=time` |

**IMPORTANT:** Keys should use the canonical convention_lock field names from state.json (use `gpd --raw convention list` to see them). Short aliases are also accepted by the `ASSERT_CONVENTION` parser used by convention validation, the verifier, and the consistency checker: `metric` → `metric_signature`, `fourier` → `fourier_convention`, `units` → `natural_units`, `coupling` → `coupling_convention`, `renorm` → `renormalization_scheme`, `gauge` → `gauge_choice`. Canonical names are preferred for clarity.

**IMPORTANT:** Values must NOT contain commas (the parser splits on commas to separate key=value pairs). Prefer the canonical values shown by `gpd --raw convention list`: `mostly-minus` and `mostly-plus`, not the comma forms `(+,-,-,-)` or `(-,+,+,+)`. The parser also normalizes underscore aliases like `mostly_minus`, but the canonical lock values are hyphenated.

**Examples:**

```latex
% ASSERT_CONVENTION: natural_units=natural, metric_signature=mostly-plus, fourier_convention=physics, coupling_convention=alpha=g^2/(4pi), renormalization_scheme=MSbar, gauge_choice=Feynman
```

```python
# ASSERT_CONVENTION: natural_units=natural, metric_signature=mostly-plus, coupling_convention=alpha=g^2/(4pi), renormalization_scheme=MSbar
```

```markdown
<!-- ASSERT_CONVENTION: natural_units=natural, metric_signature=mostly-minus, fourier_convention=physics -->
```

**Important:** Values must exactly match what is stored in `state.json convention_lock`. Read them via `gpd convention list` rather than guessing. `ASSERT_CONVENTION` validation normalizes accepted key aliases and then compares the declared values against the lock.

**Verification protocol:**

1. The executor writes an `ASSERT_CONVENTION` line at the top of every derivation file it creates or modifies
2. `gpd pre-commit-check` blocks changed derivation artifacts and canonical phase verification reports when their `ASSERT_CONVENTION` header is missing or mismatched against the active project convention lock
3. A mismatch between an assertion and the lock is a **blocker** — it means the file was written under different conventions than the project standard
4. A missing assertion in a convention-gated artifact is a **blocker**; outside that gated set, any explicit `ASSERT_CONVENTION` line is still checked against the lock and a mismatch remains a **blocker**

## Research Agent Shared Protocol

The consolidated `gpd-researcher` uses modes for project survey, phase research, literature review, project mapping, and synthesis. Its default scientific contract is `references/shared/scientific-constitution.md`. Load `references/research/researcher-shared.md` only for a specific unresolved search or confidence-calibration detail; it is not default prompt context.

The five durable research outputs live under `GPD/literature/ (5 files)`; existing-project structural analysis belongs under `GPD/research-map/` through `map-research`.
