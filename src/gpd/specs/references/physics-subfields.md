# Physics Subfield References

Comprehensive guidance for working within specific physics subfields. Each subfield reference provides: key methods, standard tools, validation strategies, common pitfalls, and recommended software.

<purpose>
This reference is loaded by GPD agents when research involves a specific physics subfield. It provides:

1. **For the planner (gpd-planner):** Which methods and tools are standard for the subfield, what validation checks to include in plans
2. **For the executor (gpd-executor):** Correct conventions, standard software, typical numerical parameters
3. **For the verifier (gpd-verifier):** Subfield-specific validation strategies, known exact results, standard benchmarks
4. **For the researcher (gpd-researcher):** What tools and libraries to investigate, what communities and databases to consult

GPD is designed for physics research broadly, with particular strength in problems that involve symbolic manipulation, numerical computation, or both. Load the relevant subfield reference for your project's domain.

**Load only the subfield(s) relevant to your current project** to conserve context budget.

## Cross-Subfield Validation Patterns

Some validation strategies transcend subfield boundaries. Apply these whenever the research touches multiple domains.

**Universality:**

- Same critical exponents must appear in different physical realizations of the same universality class
- Example: 3D Ising exponents apply to liquid-gas critical point, uniaxial magnetic transitions, binary mixtures

**Dualities:**

- Strong coupling in one description = weak coupling in another
- Examples: Kramers-Wannier (2D Ising high-T <-> low-T), electric-magnetic (Montonen-Olive), AdS/CFT
- Check: observables computed on both sides of duality must agree

**Emergent Symmetries:**

- Low-energy effective theory may have more symmetry than the UV theory
- Example: Lorentz invariance emerges from lattice models at long wavelengths
- Check: verify that the additional symmetry is respected by low-energy observables

**Anomaly Matching:**

- 't Hooft anomaly matching: UV and IR descriptions must have the same anomaly
- Applies across scales: useful for constraining low-energy behavior from UV data
- Check: compute anomaly coefficients in both descriptions and verify agreement

**Holographic Correspondence:**

- Bulk gravity calculation = boundary field theory calculation (in appropriate limit)
- Check: entropy from area of horizon = entropy from boundary thermal state
- Check: bulk geodesic length = boundary correlator (in geodesic approximation)
