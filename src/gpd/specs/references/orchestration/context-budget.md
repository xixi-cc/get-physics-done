<overview>
Context windows are finite (~80% usable before the runtime compresses). Research workflows that ignore context pressure produce degraded results: missed signs, sloppy limits, forgotten conventions. Managing context is part of research discipline, not an engineering detail.

**Core principle:** A fresh context with the right files loaded outperforms a saturated context with everything accumulated. Plan segmentation, strategic context resets, and proactive handoffs are research quality tools.

**Key ratios:**

- Total window: runtime/model-dependent
- Usable before compression: ~80% of the total window
- Statusline shows scaled usage: 100% statusline = compression imminent
- After compression: prior context is summarized, detail is lost

## Context Budget by Workflow

Different workflows consume context at different rates. Use these targets to plan segmentation.

| Workflow                      | Target Budget    | Why                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard plan execution       | ~50% per plan    | Linear task sequence, moderate file reads         |
| Hypothesis-driven plan        | ~40% per plan    | PREDICT-DERIVE-VERIFY cycle is inherently heavier |
| Literature review             | ~60% per session | Heavy web fetching and synthesis                  |
| Debugging session             | ~50% per session | Iterative read-modify-test cycles                 |
| Phase planning (orchestrator) | ~40%             | Spawns subagents; main context stays lean         |
| Paper writing                 | ~50% per section | Large reference reads + iterative drafting        |

**Rule of thumb:** If a plan will touch >5 files or produce >3 derivation steps, budget ~50% and segment if needed.
</budget_allocation>

<phase_class_budget_targets>

## Phase-Class Budget Targets

Use this table as the canonical numeric guidance for orchestrator planning. Other orchestration docs should refer here instead of restating these percentages.

| Phase Class | Orchestrator Target | Primary Agent Targets | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| literature | 15-20% | researcher 40-60%, bibliographer ~30% | Heavy source intake; segment after roughly 10 papers or one coherent claim cluster |
| formulation | 15-20% | researcher ~25%, planner ~15%, executor 30-60% | Usually fits in one pass unless multiple formalisms compete |
| derivation | ~15% | planner ~10%, executor 50-70%, verifier 20-40% | Executor dominates; split if a derivation has more than about 5 intermediate results |
| numerical | 10-15% | planner ~10%, executor 40-60%, debugger ~20%, verifier 15-35% | Budget debugger headroom for convergence or environment iteration |
| validation | 10-15% | verifier 50-60%, consistency-checker ~25% | Verification is the main work; keep contract-critical checks in the first pass |
| writing | 10-25% | paper-writer 50-70%, bibliographer/referee ~15% each | Section drafts are context-heavy; process one section or review dimension at a time |
| mixed/unknown | 15-20% | executor ~50%, verifier ~30% | Default allocation until the phase class is clear |

**Adaptation rules:**

- Derivation exceeds ~50% executor budget: split the plan into sub-plans or checkpoint after a self-contained intermediate result.
- Literature exceeds ~60% researcher budget: write a structured summary and continue in a fresh researcher invocation.
- Verification exceeds ~50% verifier budget: keep contract-critical, anchor, and decisive-comparison checks in the current pass; queue optional depth for follow-up.
- Numerical debugging exceeds ~20% debugger budget: write a debugging report with hypotheses and reinvoke the debugger with that artifact.

**Plan count heuristic:** Estimate phase cost as `plan_count * tasks_per_plan * 6000` tokens. If that estimate exceeds ~80% of the model context window, verify segmentation, confirm wave parallelism, and warn on any single plan with more than 8 substantive tasks.

**Summary aggregation heuristic:** For wave aggregation, estimate a full `SUMMARY.md` read as about 3000 tokens. Treat `CONTEXT_BUDGET` as the usable-token budget when the workflow provides it; otherwise assume the runtime-specific usable window described above. If reading summaries would exceed the orchestrator target for the phase class, switch to `gpd --raw summary-extract <path> --field one_liner` before loading full files.

<context_consumption>

## What Consumes Context

**Heavy consumers (watch these):**

| Activity                        | Approximate Cost   | Notes                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Reading a large derivation file | 2-8k tokens        | Scales with file length        |
| Full PLAN.md read               | 1-3k tokens        | Complex plans with many tasks  |
| Lengthy symbolic derivation     | 5-15k tokens       | Multi-step algebra accumulates |
| Numerical output + analysis     | 3-10k tokens       | Data tables, convergence logs  |
| Literature search results       | 5-15k tokens       | Web fetch results are verbose  |
| Error investigation cycle       | 3-8k per iteration | Read-diagnose-fix-verify loops |
| Tool call overhead              | ~0.5k per call     | Adds up over many calls        |

**Light consumers:**

| Activity             | Approximate Cost |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Reading STATE.md     | 0.5-1k tokens    |
| Short config reads   | 0.2-0.5k tokens  |
| Git operations       | 0.3-1k tokens    |
| Simple bash commands | 0.2-0.5k tokens  |

**Subagent advantage:** Each subagent (gpd-executor, gpd-planner, etc.) gets a fresh context window. The orchestrator's context stays lean. This is why `../../workflows/execute-plan.md` routes non-interactive work to subagents.
</context_consumption>

<pressure_signs>

## Signs of Context Pressure

**Early warning (50-65% statusline):**

- You've read many files but haven't started the core derivation yet
- Multiple large reference documents loaded
- Several error-fix-retry cycles completed

**Moderate pressure (65-80% statusline):**

- Derivation steps are getting longer with more intermediate algebra
- You're re-reading files you read earlier (may indicate compression already happened)
- Responses feel like they're missing context from earlier in the conversation

**Critical (80-95% statusline):**

- Compression is imminent or has already occurred
- Risk of losing derivation context, parameter values, sign conventions
- Quality of physics reasoning may degrade

**Emergency (95%+ / skull icon):**

- Context will compress imminently
- Save state NOW via `gpd:pause-work`
- Do NOT start new derivations or calculations
  </pressure_signs>

<segmentation_guidelines>

## Plan Segmentation Strategy

Plans should be sized to fit within context budget. Segment when a plan would exceed ~50% of usable context.

**Indicators a plan needs segmentation:**

- More than 6-8 substantive tasks
- Multiple independent derivations that don't share intermediate results
- Tasks that each require reading different large reference files
- Numerical computations with extensive output analysis
- Mix of symbolic derivation and numerical verification

**How to segment:**

1. **By natural physics boundaries:** Separate derivation from numerical verification. Separate independent observables.
2. **By dependency structure:** Tasks that share intermediate results stay together. Independent tasks can split.
3. **By checkpoint placement:** Checkpoints are natural segment boundaries -- verification checkpoints especially.
4. **By file scope:** Tasks touching the same files stay together. Different file sets can split.

**Segment boundary protocol:**

- Each segment produces committed, self-contained results
- Later segments can read committed files from earlier segments via `@context` references
- SUMMARY.md for each segment captures key results, parameter values, and conventions

**Anti-pattern:** Don't segment so aggressively that each segment lacks the context to verify its own physics. A derivation + its limiting case check should be in the same segment.
</segmentation_guidelines>

<context_reset_and_resume>

## When to Reset Context and Resume

**Always reset context between:**

- Phase planning and phase execution (orchestrator context vs executor context)
- Completing one plan and starting the next
- Literature review and derivation work
- Debugging session and resumption of normal execution

**Consider a fresh context reset when:**

- Statusline shows >65% (moderate pressure)
- You've finished a logical unit of work (completed a derivation, verified a result)
- You're about to start a task requiring heavy file reads
- Error investigation consumed significant context

**Before resetting context, always:**

1. Commit all work in progress
2. Update STATE.md with current position
3. If mid-plan: create `.continue-here.md` via `gpd:pause-work`
4. Ensure intermediate results are saved to files (not just in conversation memory)

**After resetting context:**

1. `gpd:resume-work` reloads the project's canonical continuation state, then uses any handoff artifact or derivation history only as supporting context
2. Re-read only the files needed for the next unit of work
3. Do NOT re-read files from completed work unless needed for reference

**The goal:** Start each work unit with a fresh, focused context containing exactly what's needed.
</context_reset_and_resume>

<planning_for_context>

## Planning with Context in Mind

When creating plans (via gpd:plan-phase), consider context budget:

**Plan-level considerations:**

- Each plan should target ~50% context usage (40% for hypothesis-driven)
- If a phase has extensive work, split into multiple plans rather than one large plan
- Assign waves so independent plans execute in parallel subagents (each gets fresh context)

**Task-level considerations:**

- Front-load `@context` file reads -- read what you need early, not repeatedly
- Group related tasks that share context (same derivation, same files)
- Place verification tasks immediately after the derivation they verify
- Don't scatter related checks across distant tasks

**Context-aware plan structure:**

```
Plan 1 (wave 1): Core derivation + immediate verification
  - Tasks share the same intermediate results
  - ~50% context budget

Plan 2 (wave 1): Independent numerical computation
  - Different files, different methods
  - Parallel with Plan 1 (separate subagent = fresh context)

Plan 3 (wave 2): Synthesis requiring results from Plans 1+2
  - Reads committed results from earlier plans
  - Fresh context for synthesis work
```

**Flag in plan frontmatter:** If a plan is estimated to be context-heavy, note it:

```yaml
context_note: "Heavy - multiple long derivations. Consider splitting if >6 tasks."
```

</planning_for_context>

<execution_awareness>

## Context Awareness During Execution

During plan execution, monitor context usage:

**After each task:**

1. Glance at statusline context percentage
2. If >50%: assess remaining work volume
3. If remaining work is heavy AND context >60%: consider proactive pause

**Proactive pause protocol:**

1. Commit current task's work
2. Note completed tasks and remaining tasks
3. Create `.continue-here.md` with derivation state, parameter values, intermediate results
4. Recommend a fresh context reset, then `gpd:resume-work`

**Never do when context is heavy:**

- Start a new multi-step derivation
- Read large reference files "just in case"
- Begin error investigation that may require multiple iterations
- Start numerical experiments with uncertain convergence
  </execution_awareness>

<agent_context_profiles>

## Context Consumption by Agent Type

Different GPD agents have different context profiles:

| Agent                | Typical Usage | Why                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| gpd-executor         | 40-70%        | Executes tasks, reads files, runs derivations |
| gpd-planner          | 30-50%        | Reads research + state, produces plans        |
| gpd-researcher | 40-60%        | Web searches, literature, synthesis           |
| gpd-plan-checker     | 20-30%        | Reads plans, checks against goals             |
| gpd-verifier         | 30-50%        | Reads results, runs validation checks         |
| gpd-debugger         | 50-80%        | Iterative investigation, heavy reads          |
| gpd-paper-writer     | 50-70%        | Large reference reads + iterative drafting    |

**Implication for orchestrators:** When spawning subagents, the orchestrator context stays lean (~20-30%). Subagent work does NOT consume orchestrator context. This is a key architectural advantage -- use subagents for heavy work.

## Worked Examples: Token Estimates

### Example 1: One-Loop QFT Calculation

A typical one-loop QFT calculation (setup + regularization + renormalization + limiting cases):

| Step | Token Cost | Cumulative |
