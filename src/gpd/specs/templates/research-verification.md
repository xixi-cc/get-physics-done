# Research Verification Template

Template for `GPD/phases/01-benchmark/{phase}-VERIFICATION.md` -- persistent research verification session tracking.

A conversational walkthrough of research results, checking derivation logic, physical intuition, edge cases, and overall soundness.
Use `{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/templates/verification-report.md` for the canonical verification frontmatter contract. Use `{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/templates/contract-results-schema.md` for the canonical ledger field rules. This template only adds the researcher-session body scaffold (`Current Check`, conversational logs, and diagnosis flow), so its verification-side `suggested_contract_checks` entries are part of the same canonical schema surface and must stay aligned with that shared schema instead of inventing a second checklist format.
Keep the contract-backed frontmatter explicit: `uncertainty_markers` stay non-empty, theorem/proof claims remain `partial` or `blocked` until the proof audit is complete and every declared proof-specific acceptance test passes, and any active convention lock still requires a machine-readable `ASSERT_CONVENTION` comment after the YAML frontmatter.
Non-canonical frontmatter aliases are forbidden in model-facing output; use only the canonical contract-ledger fields from `contract_results`.

<section_rules>

**Frontmatter:**

- `status`: use verification-report vocabulary - `passed|gaps_found|expert_needed|human_needed`
- `phase`: IMMUTABLE - set on creation
- `verified`: OVERWRITE - latest verification timestamp
- `score`: OVERWRITE - contract-backed verification progress summary
- `plan_contract_ref`, `contract_results`, `comparison_verdicts`, `suggested_contract_checks`: must follow `verification-report.md` / `contract-results-schema.md`; do not restate their closed schema here
- `source`: IMMUTABLE - SUMMARY files being validated; keep this as a YAML list even when only one SUMMARY path is present
- `started`: IMMUTABLE - set on creation
- `updated`: OVERWRITE - update on every change
- `session_status`: optional session-progress field for `validating|completed|diagnosed`

**Current Check:**

- OVERWRITE entirely on each check transition
- Shows which check is active and what's awaited
- On completion: "[verification complete]"

**Checks:**

- Each check: OVERWRITE result field when researcher responds
- `result` values: [pending], pass, issue, skipped
- If issue: add `reported` (verbatim) and `severity` (inferred)
- If skipped: add `reason` if provided
- Use `check_subject_kind` for body-only verification checkpoints so it cannot be confused with frontmatter `comparison_verdicts.subject_kind`
- Every check should carry `check_subject_kind` / `subject_id` when the PLAN contract provides one
- Keep `check_subject_kind` and `gap_subject_kind` aligned with the canonical frontmatter-safe subject vocabulary
- Use `forbidden_proxy_id` for explicit proxy-rejection checks
- Use `comparison_kind` / `comparison_reference_id` when the check should later emit a comparison verdict
- Use `suggested_contract_checks` only when the verifier believes the contract omitted a decisive check, or when a decisive benchmark / cross-method check remains partial, not attempted, or still lacks a decisive verdict
- Keep `suggested_contract_checks` schema-tight by following `contract-results-schema.md`; when the entry comes from `gpd --raw verify suggest-checks`, the frontmatter `check` value must copy the returned `check_key`
- `suggested_subject_kind` and `suggested_subject_id` travel together; if the missing check is not bound to a known contract target yet, omit both keys instead of leaving one blank

**Summary:**

- OVERWRITE counts after each response
- Tracks: total, passed, issues, pending, skipped, comparison_verdicts_recorded, forbidden_proxies_rejected

**Comparison Verdicts:**

- APPEND when a decisive comparison is performed
- Record verdicts against contract IDs rather than prose labels
- Use `subject_kind: claim|deliverable|acceptance_test|reference` only; contract-backed verdicts do not accept ad-hoc `artifact` or `other` subject kinds
- Only `subject_role: decisive` closes a decisive requirement; `supporting` / `supplemental` verdicts are informative context
- Keep the matching frontmatter `comparison_verdicts` array synchronized; body-only verdicts do not satisfy contract validation

**Suggested Contract Checks:**

- APPEND when the verifier identifies a missing decisive check
- Keep these generic and actionable: what to add, why, and where the evidence should come from
- Required before final validation whenever a decisive benchmark / cross-method check remains `partial` / `not_attempted` or a decisive comparison verdict is still missing

**Gaps:**

- APPEND only when issue found (YAML format)
- Use `gap_subject_kind` for the body scaffold that feeds `gpd:plan-phase --gaps`; reserve bare `subject_kind` for canonical frontmatter ledgers such as `comparison_verdicts`
- Keep `gap_subject_kind` to `claim|deliverable|acceptance_test|reference`; use `forbidden_proxy_id` for explicit proxy-rejection gaps and `suggested_contract_checks` for missing decisive work
- This export surface feeds directly into gpd:plan-phase --gaps
- Keep diagnosis-only detail (`root_cause`, `artifacts`, `missing`, `debug_session`) in the surrounding diagnosis notes or a debug artifact, not in the export snippet above

</section_rules>

<check_categories>

Research verification checks fall into these categories, ordered by diagnostic power:

### 1. Derivation Logic Walkthrough

Walk through the key steps of a derivation, asking the researcher to confirm each logical step.

- "In going from Eq. (3) to Eq. (4), we commuted H_0 and V. Is this valid given [conditions]?"
- "The saddle point approximation in step 5 requires [condition]. Does this hold in our parameter regime?"
- "We dropped the O(lambda^3) terms. Given lambda = 0.3, is this justified?"

### 2. Physical Intuition Probes

Ask whether results match physical expectations without looking at the math.

- "The ground state energy increases with coupling. Does this match your intuition for this system?"
- "The correlation length diverges as T -> T_c from above. Is the exponent reasonable for this universality class?"
- "The entropy is negative at low temperature. Is this physical?"

### 3. Limiting Case Spot Checks

Pick specific limits and ask the researcher to verify the behavior.

- "In the non-interacting limit (g=0), our expression reduces to [X]. Does this match the free theory?"
- "At infinite temperature, the partition function should be [dim of Hilbert space]. We get [Y]. Agree?"
- "For a single particle (N=1), the result should reduce to [textbook formula]. Does it?"

### 4. Edge Case Probes

Explore parameter regimes where things might break.

- "What happens at the phase transition point? Our expression has a [pole/divergence/discontinuity]. Is this expected?"
- "For very large N, the computation gives [X]. Is this consistent with the thermodynamic limit?"
- "At zero temperature, the partition function should project onto the ground state. Does our expression do this?"

### 5. Consistency Cross-Checks

Verify that different parts of the research are consistent with each other.

- "The perturbative result (Phase 2) and the numerical result (Phase 3) differ by 5% at coupling g=0.1. Is this within expected error?"
- "The analytical continuation from Euclidean to Lorentzian gives [X]. Is this consistent with the real-time simulation?"
- "The Ward identity requires [relation]. Do our computed Green's functions satisfy it?"
- "A benchmark comparison was required for claim `claim-main`. Do the observed numbers justify a pass, tension, fail, or inconclusive verdict?"
- "The plan forbids treating the intermediate fit quality as a success proxy. Did we accidentally rely on that instead of the decisive observable?"

### 6. Robustness and Sensitivity

Probe how sensitive results are to assumptions and approximations.

- "If we change the UV cutoff by a factor of 2, how much does the result change?"
- "The result depends on the regularization scheme. Have we checked scheme independence of physical observables?"
- "We used 5000 disorder realizations. Is the statistical error bar reliable, or do we need more?"

</check_categories>

<diagnosis_lifecycle>

**After verification complete (`session_status: completed`), if gaps exist:**

1. Researcher triggers diagnosis (from verify-work offer or manually)
2. debug workflow spawns parallel debug agents
3. Each agent investigates one gap, returns root cause
4. Diagnosis details are recorded in the session narrative or linked debug artifact, while the `gpd:plan-phase --gaps` export stays on the canonical gap keys
5. `session_status` -> "diagnosed" while final `status` stays in verification-report vocabulary (typically `gaps_found` until every gap is explicitly closed)
6. Ready for gpd:plan-phase --gaps without schema drift

If you also keep richer local diagnosis notes, keep them explicitly separate from the `gpd:plan-phase --gaps` export.

</diagnosis_lifecycle>

<lifecycle>

**Creation:** When gpd:verify-work starts new verification session

- Extract checks from the PLAN `contract` first, then use SUMMARY.md files and verification report as evidence maps
- Use PLAN `contract` IDs as canonical check names. SUMMARY `contract_results` tells you where evidence lives, not what counts as success.
- Organize by check category (derivation logic, intuition, limits, edges, consistency, robustness)
- Include explicit forbidden-proxy rejection checks and decisive comparison checks when the contract requires them
- Add `suggested_contract_checks` if the verifier finds a missing decisive check
- Set session_status to "validating"
- Current Check points to check 1
- All checks have result: [pending]

**During verification:**

- Present check from Current Check section
- Researcher responds with confirmation or concern
- Update check result (pass/issue/skipped)
- Update Summary counts
- If issue: append to Gaps section (YAML format), infer severity
- Move Current Check to next pending check

**On completion:**

- `status` stays in canonical verification vocabulary (`passed | gaps_found | expert_needed | human_needed`)
- `session_status` -> "completed"
- Current Check -> "[verification completed]"
- Commit file
- Present summary with next steps

**Resume after a fresh context reset:**

1. Read frontmatter -> know phase and status
2. Read Current Check -> know where we are
3. Find first [pending] result -> continue from there
4. Summary shows progress so far

</lifecycle>

<severity_guide>

Severity is INFERRED from researcher's natural language, never asked.

| Researcher describes                                                               | Infer    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Wrong sign, diverges unphysically, violates conservation law, negative probability | blocker  |
| Doesn't match known limit, off by factor of 2, wrong exponent, suspicious behavior | major    |
| Slightly off, small discrepancy, could be numerical artifact, minor concern        | minor    |
| Notation inconsistency, plot formatting, labeling, style issue                     | cosmetic |

Default: **major** (safe default, researcher can clarify if wrong)

</severity_guide>

Multi-source `source` frontmatter stays a YAML list:
source:
  - "03-01-SUMMARY.md"
  - "03-02-SUMMARY.md"
  - "03-03-SUMMARY.md"

<guidelines>

**What makes good verification checks:**

- Each check should be answerable by a physicist reviewing the results
- Checks should probe understanding, not just ask "is this right?"
- Include the expected answer or behavior so disagreement is clear
- Mix high-level intuition checks with detailed quantitative spot-checks
- Order from most diagnostic (derivation logic) to least (robustness)

**Conversation style:**

- Present one check at a time
- Frame checks as collaborative discussion, not an exam
- If the researcher spots something, explore it before moving on
- Adapt subsequent checks based on earlier findings (if a normalization is wrong, check downstream consequences)

**When to use research verification:**

- During or after a research phase when automated verification needs human physics judgment
- When results need human physics judgment beyond automated checks
- Before publishing or building on results in later phases
- When the verification report frontmatter honestly remains `human_needed`, `expert_needed`, or `gaps_found`

**When NOT to use:**

- As a second incompatible verification format; keep using the same frontmatter contract as `verification-report.md`
- When all checks can be performed programmatically
- For implementation bugs (use standard debugging)

</guidelines>
