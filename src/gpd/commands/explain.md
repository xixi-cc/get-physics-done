<objective>
Route a request for a rigorous explanation into the workflow-owned implementation.

This wrapper owns command-context validation and the public output-root boundary only. The same-named workflow owns scope clarification, context gathering, explainer delegation, citation audit, result lookup, and reporting.

Use the current main context by default. Delegate only for a concrete independence, parallelism or context need; citation verification remains evidence-based on either route.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/workflows/explain.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Concept, result, method, notation, or paper: $ARGUMENTS

GPD-authored explanation artifacts stay under `GPD/explanations/` rooted at the current workspace.
Use `{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/results/result-lookup-policy.md` for upstream result dependencies.
If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty in standalone mode, stop and ask the user to rerun with an explicit concept/topic.

</context>

<process>

## 0. Validate Context

```bash
CONTEXT=$(gpd --raw validate command-context explain "$ARGUMENTS")
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "$CONTEXT"
  exit 1
fi
```

## 1. Parse Request

Let the included workflow handle target clarification, project/standalone mode, result-registry lookup, explainer delegation, citation auditing, and final reporting.

Follow the included explain workflow end-to-end.
</process>

<success_criteria>

- [ ] Standalone or project context validated
- [ ] Explain workflow executed as the authority for mechanics
- [ ] Explanation artifacts kept under the current workspace's `GPD/explanations/`
