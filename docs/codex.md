# Codex Quickstart for GPD

Use this if you are a physics researcher and want GPD inside the OpenAI Codex
CLI.

This guide uses the simplest path to get started. OpenAI's official Codex docs
may list additional install, auth, or platform-specific options.

Back to the onboarding hub: [GPD Onboarding Hub](./README.md).

## Choose this runtime if

Use Codex if you want GPD inside the OpenAI Codex CLI and are comfortable with
the `$gpd-...` command style.

The official Codex CLI docs list macOS, Windows, and Linux support. On Windows,
run Codex natively in PowerShell with the Windows sandbox for the normal path,
or use WSL2 when your repository or tools need a Linux-native environment.

## What must already be true

- You already have Codex installed and can launch `codex` from your normal
  terminal.
- Node.js 20+ and Python 3.11+ with `venv` are installed.
- You are in the folder where you want this research project to live.
- This guide uses `--local`, so GPD is installed only for the current folder.

## 1) Confirm `codex` works

From your normal terminal:

```bash
codex --help
```

If that prints help text, Codex is installed and launchable.
If `codex` is missing, install the runtime first with:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

## 2) Install, start, and use GPD

<!-- gpd-public-surface:runtime-quickstart-codex:start -->
From your normal terminal:

```bash
npx -y get-physics-done --codex --local
codex
```

Inside Codex:

```text
$gpd-help
$gpd-start
$gpd-tour
$gpd-new-project --minimal
$gpd-map-research
$gpd-resume-work
```

Suggested order for beginners: `$gpd-help`, `$gpd-start`, `$gpd-tour`, then either `$gpd-new-project --minimal`, `$gpd-map-research`, or `$gpd-resume-work`.

Return to work from your normal terminal with `gpd resume` or `gpd resume --recent`, then reopen `codex` in the right folder and run `$gpd-resume-work`.

After your first successful start or later, use `$gpd-settings` to review autonomy, workflow defaults, model-cost posture, runtime permission sync, and preset/tier overrides. The safest starting point is `review` plus runtime defaults. Favor scientific rigor and explicit uncertainty over agreement-seeking, and keep missing evidence or artifacts explicit instead of inventing them.
<!-- gpd-public-surface:runtime-quickstart-codex:end -->

The first time you run Codex, it should prompt you to sign in with your ChatGPT account or an API key.

### Optional: reduce automatic skill discovery

The default `lean` projection installs 14 workflow skills plus one automatic
`gpd-router` entry. The other 57 canonical operation IDs remain available through
MCP `get_skill`, with their original command requirements and state authority.
They are not native `$gpd-*` slash skills in lean installations. Describe the
task normally; the router selects and loads the operation without a manual mode.

```bash
gpd install codex --local --projection lean
```

Use `--projection full` when a client needs all 71 native slash skill entries.
This changes discovery/installation, not scientific contracts or model settings.
The grouped operation catalog is `references/shared/workflow-catalog.md`.

## What success looks like

You are in the right place when:

- `codex --help` works.
- `npx -y get-physics-done --codex --local` finishes without errors.
- Inside Codex, `$gpd-help` shows the GPD command list.
- `$gpd-start` routes a beginner to the right entry point.
- `$gpd-tour` gives a read-only walkthrough of the main commands.
- `$gpd-new-project --minimal`, `$gpd-map-research`, or `$gpd-resume-work` starts the right GPD flow for new work, existing research, or an existing GPD project.

## Quick troubleshooting

- If a command is missing, make sure you are typing it inside Codex, not in your normal terminal.
- If `codex` is not found, install or relaunch Codex first.
- If Codex says you are not signed in, finish the Codex login flow, then rerun `$gpd-help`.
